## Tarot Cards

Tarot Cards are a form of consumable that you can obtain during a run. They can be acquired via Arcana Packs, Purple Seals, and the Shop.

Tarot Cards are used to modify various aspects of the playing cards in the deck, such as their suit or rank. They are also capable of giving cards Enhancements, giving them additional effects, such as giving extra chips or multiplier when scored. Some of them offer cash, generate new jokers or even create more consumables. There are 22 different cards available, and these unlock in your Collection when purchased or used in an unseeded run.

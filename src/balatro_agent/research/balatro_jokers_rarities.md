Jokers have four different rarities:

*   Common (61 jokers)
*   Uncommon (64 jokers)
*   Rare (20 jokers)
*   Legendary (5 jokers)

There is a 70% chance of generating a Common Joker, a 25% chance of generating an Uncommon Joker, and a 5% chance of generating a Rare Joker. A Legendary Joker can only appear from The Soul Spectral Card.

## Modifiers

Jokers can be enhanced with one of four different Editions, resulting in higher shop costs but adding an additional effect:

*   Base (standard card)
*   Foil (+50 Chips)
*   Holographic (+10 Mult)
*   Polychrome (x1.5 Mult)
*   Negative (+1 Joker slot)

In higher stakes, Jokers can also appear with Eternal, Perishable, and/or Rental Stickers.
